# Information Management System (IMS)

A clean and intuitive desktop-based Information Management System built with Python and Tkinter. This application allows users to manage information records efficiently with persistent SQLite storage.

## 🚀 Features

- **Full CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete information records.
- **Dynamic Search**: Real-time filtering of records by name or email.
- **Modern UI**: A user-friendly interface using Tkinter's `ttk` and custom styling.
- **Persistent Storage**: Data is safely stored in a local SQLite database (`ims_records.db`).
- **Validation**: Basic form validation to ensure data integrity.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **GUI Framework**: Tkinter
- **Database**: SQLite3

## 📂 Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main entry point of the application containing the GUI logic.
- `database.py`: Handles all database operations and SQL queries.
- `ims_records.db`: The SQLite database file (created automatically on first run).

## 📥 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ims-python-tkinter.git
   cd ims-python-tkinter
   ```

2. **Ensure Python is installed**:
   This project requires Python 3. Tkinter is usually included with standard Python installations.

## 🚀 Usage

Run the following command to start the application:

```bash
